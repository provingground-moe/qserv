 * Class IngestServerConnection is used for handling catalog data ingest requests
 * from remote clients. One instance of the class serves one file from one client
 * at a time.
 *
 * Objects of this class are instantiated by IngestServer. After that
 * the server calls this class's method beginProtocol() which starts
 * a series of asynchronous operations to communicate with remote client.
 * When all details of an incoming request are obtained from the client
 * the connection object begins actual processing of the request and
 * communicates with a client as required by the file transfer protocol.
 * All communications are asynchronous and they're using Google Protobuf.
 *
 * The lifespan of this object is exactly one request until it's fully
 * satisfied or any failure during request execution (when loading data into
 * a database, or communicating with a client) occurs. When this happens the object
 * stops doing anything.

     * Begin communicating asynchronously with a client. This is essentially
     * an RPC protocol which runs in a loop this sequence of steps:
     * 
     *   1. ASYNC: read a frame header of a request
     *       SYNC: read the request header (a scope and parameters of the request, etc.)
     *   2. ASYNC: write a frame header of a reply to the request
     *             followed by a status (to tell a client if parameters of the request
     *             are valid, or if the operation is possible, etc.). If there was
     *             a problem with the request then send ILLEGAL_PARAMETERS or
     *             FAILED and be done.
     *             Otherwise send READY_TO_READ_DATA to invite the client to send the first
     *             batch of rows.
     *   3. ASYNC: read a frame header of the first data request
     *       SYNC: read the body of the data request with rows to be loaded.
     *       SYNC: process and load rows into the destination table
     *   4. ASYNC: if there was a problem with loading rows then send FAILED
     *             with an explanation of the problem and be done.
     *             If not then check flag 'last' in the data request, and if the one
     *             is present send FINISHED to confirm the completion of
     *             the loading and be done.
     *             Otherwise send READ_TO_READ_DATA to encourage the client to send
     *             the next batch of rows. The reply may also be adjusted to
     *             notify the client on the maximum number of rows to be send in
     *             the next request.
     *   5 -> 3:   repeat this in the loop until ll rows are received from the client
     *             and loaded into the database, or until a problem at any stage occurs. 
     *
     * @note
     *   A reason why the read phase is split into two phases (ASYNC, SYNC) is
     *   that a client is expected to send all components of the request
     *   (frame header and request body) at once. This means the whole incoming
     *   message will be already available on the server's host memory when an
     *   asynchronous handler for the frame header will fire.
     *   However, due to a variable length of the request we should know its length
     *   before attempting to read the rest of the incoming message as this (the later)
     *   will require two things: 1) to ensure enough we have enough buffer space
     *   allocated, and 2) to tell the asynchronous reader function
     *   how many bytes exactly are we going to read.
     * 
     * The chain ends when a client disconnects or when an error condition
     * is met.
